### A guide to participating in the open source "Dream Cinema" project

#### Our pledge
-	With the open-source project "Cinema Dream", we pledge to make community participation abuse-free for everyone, regardless of gender identity.
-	Throughout our work and interactions, we pledge to contribute to a welcoming environment.
-	Our commitment is to accept responsibility, apologize to those affected by our mistakes, and learn from them.



#### Our standards
Among the behaviors that contribute to a positive community environment are:

##### -	Be friendly and patient.
Be Welcome: We strive to create a community that is inclusive of all backgrounds and identities. It includes individuals of all races, socioeconomic classes, educational levels, genders, gender identities, ages, political beliefs, religions, etc.

##### -	Respect different opinions and experiences.
Be respectful: We won't always agree, but disagreement isn't an excuse for misbehavior. There will be times when we feel frustrated, but we shouldn't let that frustration turn into a personal attack. In order for society to be productive, people must not feel uncomfortable or threatened.
Try to understand the reason for the difference: There are always social and technical disagreements. The key to resolving differences and contrasting viewpoints is to resolve them constructively. Keep in mind that we are all different. It does not mean that someone is wrong if you do not understand why they hold a particular viewpoint. Instead, focus on solving problems and learning from them.

##### -	Be kind to others.
Choose your words carefully: Kindness to others is important. Be respectful of other participants and do not insult them. Exclusionary behavior and harassment are not acceptable.


Unacceptable behavior includes:
-	The use of sexual language or images.
-	A personal attack or derogatory remarks.
-	Harassment in public or private.
-	If you post someone else's private information, such as an email address or physical address, without their express permission, you will be breaking the law.

#### Enforcement responsibilities
Community leaders are accountable for clarifying and enforcing the rules of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair action if any inappropriate behavior is observed.
Comments, commitments, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate the Code of Conduct must be removed, edited, or rejected by community leaders.

## Announcing
If our open-source project becomes applicable, we will announce it. On the main site of the project, we will prepare advertisement pages, and then we will post advertisements on the appropriate forums. Our plan is to announce the project on the forums about "Dream Cinema" to ensure we receive the most attention. Our announcement will be short so that it gets to the heart of the matter and explain the announcement as a new project. This announcement hopes to increase both contributors and new users' participation in our open-source project over time, even if it is a slow process.
